# Solar-System-project
A python project I chose to do at University. A simulation of the Sun, and the planets Mercury through Saturn. Each planet has a mass, radius and velocity where each planet's mass influences the other planets orbits. 

The project.py contains the code to run it which was written in Spyder.
The gif is a short section of the output with the animation showing the orbits. Orbit lines were added in to make it visually better but are not needed.
The Planetary Motion document contains the maths and method behind the project including the goals I was given, along with some testing screenshots of orbits and energy levels.
